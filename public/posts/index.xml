    <description><![CDATA[Yesterday we released the 2022-04 update (Moopril) which included a change in the NGINX configuration. During the same day we received a message that SOGo would not work since the update, more precisely the login.
So we released an update yesterday evening around 23:00 (German summertime) which solves this problem in most cases.
Please update your mailcow via the update.sh Script as soon as possible to use SOGo as usual again.]]></description>

We have released an impromptu bug fix update that fixes a few minor bugs and graphical issues.
These are only minor changes this time, but as the saying goes, &ldquo;Every little bit helps&rdquo;.
  We have moved the version footer back to the correct position. Faithful to the motto: Stay were you are! We have improved the release tag handling with the version footer. The backup and restore script now uses Debian Bullseye instead of Buster.]]></description>
