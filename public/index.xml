    <description><![CDATA[Moohoo everyone! Due to the recent accidents regarding the Java library log4j we would like to inform you, that your mailcow is NOT affected directly by this.
Yes, it is true, that the Solr Container is a Java application which is affected by the log4j security breach. BUT solr is NOT accessible from the outside of the mailcow stack!
For those who are worried we released a Solr Hotfix which is fixing the log4j issue with the simple flag +EXTRA_ARGS+=('-Dlog4j2.]]></description>

Development is not stuck, we just have trouble handling many requests of new customers. Combined with cases of illness, vacation and the usual business we are really under stress.
We are also reworking the design a bit, that&rsquo;s a WIP and will take a while. The first new prints will probably be seen on our new cars @ tinc. We are very excited! There are also plans for a mailcow.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hi,
If you updated your mailcow between 25th August and 2nd September 2021 you most likely encounter a settings map memory leak in Rspamd that was fixed just now.
Besides that, we also heavily reduced the map hammering with another change in the map generator.
Update time!
