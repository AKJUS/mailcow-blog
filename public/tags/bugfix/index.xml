    <description><![CDATA[2022-05b It´s us again!
Today we have a small API Fix Update which focus mainly on the UI.
As some of you reported the API Calls for Domains/Mailboxes don´t work anymore if there is no Tag set.
This is now fixed.
Additionaly, we´ve added a small tweak for the UI. Did you know that there was a little plus symbol at the left of a Domain/Mailbox? No? Don´t worry it was a little hard to see&hellip; until now :)]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Moohoo everyone!
We have released an impromptu bug fix update that fixes a few minor bugs and graphical issues.
These are only minor changes this time, but as the saying goes, &ldquo;Every little bit helps&rdquo;.
  We have moved the version footer back to the correct position. Faithful to the motto: Stay were you are! We have improved the release tag handling with the version footer. The backup and restore script now uses Debian Bullseye instead of Buster.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Moohoo everyone! Due to the recent accidents regarding the Java library log4j we would like to inform you, that your mailcow is NOT affected directly by this.
Yes, it is true, that the Solr Container is a Java application which is affected by the log4j security breach. BUT solr is NOT accessible from the outside of the mailcow stack!
For those who are worried we released a Solr Hotfix which is fixing the log4j issue with the simple flag +EXTRA_ARGS+=('-Dlog4j2.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hi,
If you updated your mailcow between 25th August and 2nd September 2021 you most likely encounter a settings map memory leak in Rspamd that was fixed just now.
Besides that, we also heavily reduced the map hammering with another change in the map generator.
Update time!
