## 2023-12 (Release 19th December 2023)

**Moo hoo zusammen!**

We have some new Netfilter features for you before the holidays. 
In addition, the watchdog can now send notifications via webhooks. To do this, simply configure the variables `WATCHDOG_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK` and `WATCHDOG_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_BODY` in `mailcow.conf` accordingly.
