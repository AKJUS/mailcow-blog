Girls, guys and cows,

Development is not stuck, we just have trouble handling many requests of new customers. Combined with cases of illness, vacation and the usual business we are really under stress.

We are also reworking the design a bit, that's a WIP and will take a while. The first new prints will probably be seen on our new cars @ tinc. We are very excited! There are also plans for a mailcow.shop.

Kristian Feldsam already started working on the migration of the UI to BS5, that's another big step forward for us. Thank you!

André
