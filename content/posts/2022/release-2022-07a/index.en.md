Moohoo everyone!

We've released an impromptu update that documents a little better the API and brings a new version of ClamAV (0.105.1).

**Note:** The update to ClamAV 0.105.1 is recommended by ClamAV as a security update [(See ClamAV Update article)](https://blog.clamav.net/2022/07/clamav-01037-01041-and-01051-patch.html)

Once again summarized what changes:

+ The schema of the domain section of the API has been adjusted and improved.
+ Automatic GitHub actions for building the latest container versions has been set up (currently not used productively).
+ The maximum key length of the Web UI has been increased to 1023 bits (previously 255 bits)
+ ClamAV was raised to version 0.105.1.

That's it. We hope you are all safe and sound.

See you at the next update!

Stay healthy<br>
