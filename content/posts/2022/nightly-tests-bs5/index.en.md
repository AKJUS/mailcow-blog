It took long enough, but here it is finally: The new mailcow UI!

Currently it's still exclusively in the nightly builds because we want to optimize the UI.

And that's where you come in! Because we want to make the UI as user friendly as possible and improve not only the framework but also the usability.

So if there was one thing that always bothered you so far, please let us know!

We are collecting feedback on this on mailcow's GitHub page:
[https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/discussions/4734](https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/discussions/4734).

With your feedback we can optimize the mailcow UI (MUH-I) as good as possible so that old as well as new users can find their way around quickly.

So. Want to join in? Good! Then let's go for the Nightly Builds. You can find instructions [here](https://mailcow.github.io/mailcow-dockerized-docs/i_u_m/i_u_m_update/#new-get-nightly-updates).

Thank you for your feedback and testing in general. ❤️

**Your mailcow Team** <br>
