**Moohoo everyone!**

The official September update is here and brings this time unfortunately only a small update, which is not to be ignored, however.

A vulnerability is closed but no don't worry, the previous ones were worse, but this one is still not unimportant.

### Vulnerability in Swagger UI

Before we talk about the Nightly Updates, let's talk about the Swagger vulnerability.

This allowed a script to be loaded via the URL call of the Swagger UI which could convert the page into a credit card phishing portal, for example.

We have opened a CVE case for this: **CVE-2022-39258**

On GitHub you can read the more detailed informations: https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-vjgf-cp5p-wm45

Before panic kicks in this is the most harmless of the security vulnerabilities so far.

We advise (as always) to update soon of course!

### Nightly changes (Bootstrap 5 update)

So, let's move on to the Nightly Updates, which are fully focused on the Bootstrap 5 update:

* [NEW] Sieve Access can now be toggled via Mass-Actions
* [NEW] Added a Loading Animation for the Container Charts
* [NEW] The Public IP-Adresses of your Mailserver (done with dig inside the containers) are now displayed on the Dashboard Page.
* [FIX] Fixed some Layout Issues (especially Color Changes)

As some of you may have inferred, we are listening to your feedback regarding the Bootstrap 5 update. We are still diligently collecting feedback on this.

Either here on [GitHub](https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/discussions/4734), on [Telegram](https://t.me/mailcow), at the [Forum](https://community.mailcow.email/d/1914-feedback-auf-bootstrap-5-ui-update-gesucht) or simply via Mail to info@mailcow.email.
