Hello all,

Yesterday we received an important tip about a critical security vulnerability in mailcow (thanks again for that). It affects IMAPSYNC and gives access to administration rights in the mailcow UI and API.

***It is strongly recommended to install the update as soon as possible to prevent exploitation.***

As always please take a look at the GitHub Release: https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2022-05d

**The update does not remove any important functionality from mailcow or IMAPSYNC!**

Stay stafe
