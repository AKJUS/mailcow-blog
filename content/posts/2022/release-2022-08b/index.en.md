**Moohoo everyone!**

A small but important update for or against the current SOGo Sieve/mail sending problems is here!

We received countless messages about this and implemented a fix within tis update, which hopefully solves the problem for everyone.

For those who are interested: It's probably related to the IPv6 support introduced in SOGo 5.7.1 and the internal IPv6 connectivity of mailcow¬¥s Docker containers, which triggered connectivity issues with SOGo.

Yeah... however, this bug should be fixed now. If not: Don't be afraid to file an issue on GitHub, that helps us a lot!

Furthermore, the mailcow Ansible role has now been made fully compatible with the new Nightly Switch again.

Thats all for now.

Until then. All the best and stay healthy.
