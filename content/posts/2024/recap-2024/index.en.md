**Dear mailcow Community,**

2024 is coming to an end, and we, too, are heading into a well-deserved winter break.

<!--more-->

## Looking Back and Forward

We originally planned a mailcow update for this week, but it has been postponed to January. Thorough testing remains a priority for us, and unfortunately, we couldn’t find the time during the pre-Christmas season.

But don’t worry: in 2025, we’ll continue to improve mailcow and introduce new features. Among them (finally, here’s some news!) is the long-awaited LDAP update, which is almost ready for release. Stay tuned for more details next year – we’re sure you’ll love it!

2024 brought some fantastic new features to the mailcow world, including:

- A "forgot password" feature,
- A feature for renaming mailboxes.

And those are just two of the highlights!

## A Big Thank You to Our Supporters

For this, a huge thank you!

## Community Heroes

We’d also like to thank everyone who takes the time to **freely** and completely **voluntarily** support the community – especially in our [Telegram group](https://t.me/mailcow) and our [community forum](https://community.mailcow.email)!

Thank you, thank you, thank you! You keep the community together and help keep the joy of open-source systems and emailing alive.

## Last but Not Least: Thank You All

And of course, we want to thank all mailcow users. Why? Because it’s **you** who chose **mailcow** and use it every day! You contribute to an open internet free from provider constraints – and that alone deserves a big thank you!
