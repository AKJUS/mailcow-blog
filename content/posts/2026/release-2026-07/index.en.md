## 2026-07a (Release: 30th July 2026)

This revision update addresses several **security-related issues** in mailcow, bumps **rspamd to 4.1.4** and fixes **CVE-2026-42533** in Nginx. The Nginx CVE was not necessarily critical for mailcow, but we bump it anyway just to be on the safe side. On top of that we fixed a few more bugs.

**We strongly recommend updating your mailcow instance to this version as soon as possible.**

**Important note:** The mailcow-related CVE identifiers will be published next week at the latest.

## 2026-07 (Release: 13th July 2026)

**Moohoo everyone!**

We're happy to present the **2026-07 Update**!
This release ships several major bumps at once: our **Postfix** container migrates from **Debian Bookworm to Trixie** and now runs **Postfix 3.10.12**. We also bump **rspamd** to a fresh **version 4.1.0** (a major jump from 3.x), update **SOGo to 5.12.9** and **Nginx to 1.30.3**. On top of that come several smaller UI fixes and the usual translation and postscreen updates.

---

**⚠️ Important Note:**
This update includes significant changes to the underlying container images (among others the jump from Debian 12 to Debian 13 in the Postfix container and a major upgrade of rspamd). We **strongly recommend creating a backup** of your mailcow installation before updating, just to be on the safe side.
