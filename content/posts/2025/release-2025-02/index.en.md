**Moohoo everyone**

It's time for another update.  

This time, we've updated Rspamd to 3.11-2, upgraded MariaDB to 10.11, and moved our Docker images from Docker Hub to GitHub.  
Nothing too wild.

### Important Fix: Dovecot & Netfilter

Previously, Dovecot allowed multiple failed login attempts within a single session without being properly detected by Netfilter. This has now been fixed.

üìå **Action required:** Admins should reset Fail2ban Regex filters:  
System ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Fail2Ban Parameters ‚Üí Expand Regex Filters ‚Üí Click "Reset to Default"

### MariaDB Upgrade ‚Äì Now on 10.11

We've upgraded from MariaDB 10.5 to 10.11  
‚ùó Caution:
- Do not manually change the MariaDB version in your `docker-compose.yml`, as this could lead to database corruption if the code is not adapted properly.
- Downgrading is not possible! Once your databases are migrated to 10.11, there‚Äôs no way back to 10.5.

### Moving Docker Images to GitHub

Docker Hub has introduced new rate limits, so we've decided to move our custom-built mailcow Docker images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) instead.
