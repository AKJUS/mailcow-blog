# 2025-09 (Release: 10th September 2025)

**Moohoo everyone!**

We're excited to bring you the **2025-09 Update**!  
This release delivers **new features, component updates, and the usual round of bug fixes**.  

{{% admonition type="warning" title="Important" open=true >}}  
mailcow now requires `jq` to be installed on the host system in order to operate with the redesigned IPv6 controller.  
If it's missing, please install it **before** running the update, this tool is mandatory and will not be removed in a future release.

{{% admonition type="warning" title="Important" open=true >}}  
This update introduces a brand-new container: **`postfix-tlspol-mailcow`**,  which adds outbound **MTA-STS support** to Postfix.    

After updating, verify that the new container is running correctly by  reviewing the logs:  
```
docker compose logs -f --tail 200 postfix-tlspol-mailcow
```

If you encounter **CPU Problems** or **continuous restarts**, rebuild the image manually:  
```
docker build -t ghcr.io/mailcow/postfix-tlspol:1.0 data/Dockerfiles/postfix-tlspol
docker compose up -d
```
