# 2025-10 (Release: 15th October 2025)

**Moohoo everyone!**

We're excited to bring you the **2025-10 Update**!  
This release includes several bug fixes and updates **Rspamd** to version **3.13.2** and **Redis** to version **7.4.6**.

The Redis update addresses [CVE-2025-49844](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-4789-qfc9-5f9q).  
**We recommend updating your installation**, but there is no need to panic.  
The vulnerability can only be exploited by an **authenticated user**.
In mailcow, Redis is used **locally only** and is **protected by a password**, meaning an attacker would need both **system access** and the **Redis credentials** to take advantage of this issue.
