# 2025-03 (Release: 25th March 2025)

**Moohoo everyone,**

We are happy to announce the release of **mailcow: dockerized 2025-03**!

This release includes features that have been tested in the nightly branch over the past year. If you‚Äôve been following our [nightly progress update](https://mailcow.email/posts/2025/nightly-progress/), you may already be familiar with some of the changes listed below.

**Before updating, please ensure you have a current backup of your installation.**

{{< admonition type=warning title="Warning" >}}
This update heavily changes the authentication process. If you don‚Äôt want to apply the 2025-03 update, you can switch to the legacy branch with `./update.sh --legacy`.  
The legacy branch will **only** receive security updates until February 2026.  
[Read more about the legacy branch](https://docs.mailcow.email/maintenance/update/#update-variants)
{{< /admonition >}}

## Breaking Changes

Logins for Administrator, Domain Administrator, and Users have been separated:

- **Administrator Login:** `/admin`  
- **Domain Administrator Login:** `/domainadmin`  
- **Users:** `/`

Direct SOGo login is now disabled. All unauthenticated requests to `/SOGo` will be redirected to `/`.  
Users must use the mailcow login.  
Administrators can define whether a user should be redirected to the mailcow UI or SOGo after login.

## Other Notable Changes

- All Alpine-based images have been updated to Alpine 3.21.
- 2FA protected mailboxes will need an app password for authentication with mail protocols.

## New Feature

mailcow now supports **external Identity Providers** for authentication.  
This is optional ‚Äî administrators can configure an external identity provider, which can be used alongside the SQL database for authentication.  
You can even configure which authentication source a specific user should use.

Currently supported Identity Providers:

1. **Keycloak** ‚Äì [Documentation](https://docs.mailcow.email/manual-guides/mailcow-UI/u_e-mailcow_ui-keycloak/)  
2. **LDAP/AD** ‚Äì [Documentation](https://docs.mailcow.email/manual-guides/mailcow-UI/u_e-mailcow_ui-ldap/)  
3. **Generic OIDC** ‚Äì [Documentation](https://docs.mailcow.email/manual-guides/mailcow-UI/u_e-mailcow_ui-generic-oidc/)

## Improvements

mailcow now uses **Dovecot's password caching** to reduce authentication-related load.

### Benchmarks

| Caching | Auth Source | Server Load Peak | Time for 2000 Logins (seconds) |
|---------|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| ‚ùå      | SQL         | ~13              | 91.24                         |
| ‚ùå      | LDAP        | ~4               | 37.94                         |
| ‚úÖ      | SQL         | ~6               | 23.16                         |
| ‚úÖ      | LDAP        | ~2               | 23.17                         |
