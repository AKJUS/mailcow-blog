**Moohoo everyone!**

Our dear **mailcow** has taken the plunge into social media: **Twitter**!

There she will provide you with **new release information** or **small hints** about possible new features as well as **general information** about the mailcow project.

Of course you can also tweet about your experiences with mailcow. Just use the Twitter handle: **[@mailcow_email](https://twitter.com/mailcow_email "@mailcow_email")**.

We look forward to getting in touch with you there and keeping you up to date.

**Stay healthy!** \
