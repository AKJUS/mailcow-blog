Yesterday we released the 2022-04 update (Moopril) which included a change in the NGINX configuration. During the same day we received a message that SOGo would not work since the update, more precisely the login.

So we released an update yesterday evening around 23:00 (German summertime) which solves this problem in most cases.

Please update your mailcow via the update.sh Script as soon as possible to use SOGo as usual again.

We apologize for this error.
