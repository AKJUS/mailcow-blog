## 3. Hosting and Data Processing by GitHub
Our website is hosted by **GitHub Pages**, a service provided by GitHub Inc., 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.

When you access our site, the following data is automatically processed and temporarily stored by GitHub:
- IP address of the accessing device,
- date and time of the request,
- browser type and operating system,
- referrer URL,
- accessed pages/files.

This data is required for technical operation, security purposes, and to optimize the offering. The legal basis is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest).

## 4. Data Transfers to Third Countries
GitHub is headquartered in the USA, and therefore data processing in the USA may occur. GitHub is certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. More information: [https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)

## 5. No Personal Data Collected by Us
We do not collect personal data through the blog ourselves, as no comment functions, contact forms, registrations, or other interactions are offered.

## 6. Data Retention
According to GitHub, server log files are typically stored for 14 days. Beyond that, we do not store any personal data.

## 7. Your Rights
You have the right to:
- access your stored data (Art. 15 GDPR),
- correction (Art. 16 GDPR),
- deletion (Art. 17 GDPR),
- restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR),
- object to processing (Art. 21 GDPR),
- data portability (Art. 20 GDPR),
- lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g., the data protection authority of North Rhine-Westphalia).

## 8. TLS Encryption
Our website uses TLS encryption (HTTPS). This ensures that data exchanged between your browser and our server is protected from unauthorized access.
